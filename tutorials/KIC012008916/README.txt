Tutorial for the peak fitting and peak significance test of the red giant star KIC 12008916 using the StandardBackgroundModel and a LorentzianSincMixtureModel.
To run the tutorial follow the procedure:
1 - Move the files localPath.txt and multirun into PeakBagging/build/
2 - Edit the path inside the localPath.txt to match your local working path
3 - Move the file KIC012008916.txt into PeakBagging/data/
4 - Move the remaining files into PeakBagging/results/KIC012008916/
5 - Run the code for the StandardBackgroundModel from PeakBagging/build/, after the localPath.txt file has been set with your local working path
